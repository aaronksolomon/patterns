# Repair Markdown Simple

## Task

Repair the following markdown document.

- Numbered elements should always be section headings with '#', and should use a standard simple numbering format:
  -  e.g. "1)", "2." should always be converted to "#..# 1. ..." 
  - Use subsections such as 2.1, 2.2 for numbered sections.
- Do not re-use heading titles. (e.g. '### Summary' in two places in the text). 
   - If necessary, add a section number such as '2.1' or other relative context such as the next higher level heading
     in order to create unique headings.
- Use the top level heading (with a single '#') only at top of the document for the title.
- If a document title is not clearly at the top of the document, create an appropriate title.
- Ensure
- All other headings should begin with two or more '#'s
- Ensure consistent heading levels (e.g. number of '#'s) to organize content logically.
  - Ensure that heading level increases only by one '#' at a time.
- Use '-' for all unordered list elements.
- Make sure all section headings marked with '#' are surrounded by blank newlines.
- Ensure that all lines end without trailing whitespace.
- Ensure there is an empty closing newline for the document.
- Repair any inconsistencies or markdown formatting errors.
- Use Markdown best practices.

## Output

- Give the markdown text only, without any wrapping characters such as backticks `
- Make no comments or other modifications to the content of the text.
- Change only the markdown structure.
